Imagine yourself standing at the edge of an endless precipice, with the wind whispering secrets that only the bravest hearts can hear. The air is electric with anticipation, like a giant's collective breath before the greatest leap forward in human history. That's where Aria stood – poised between two worlds: one she knew, and one she only dared to dream of.
